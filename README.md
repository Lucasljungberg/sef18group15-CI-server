### Email Notifications
Email notifications are sent to all the group members (from a dummy email address) after each commit regarding the status of the commit (corresponding build).

The sendEmail function is implemented in the SendEmail.java file and tested in the SendEmailTest.java file. Gmail is used as the mail service, and the dummy user (from whose address the emails are sent) is authorised using their Gmail email address and password. In the test file, a test email is being sent to Olzhas' email address.
